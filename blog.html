                    <h2>Introduction </h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a free scripting language that works on client-side as well as server-side. It is
                        text-based and works along-side HTML and CSS to enhance code functionality and add interactive
                        elements.
                        In short, JS can bring life to otherwise boring and static web pages. JS is interpreted, which
                        means the code need not be compiled. For huge projects that use a lot of interactive content,
                        separate JavaScript files with the extension .js are created. However, JS can also be embedded
                        in HTML code using tag. Some common use-cases of JS are interactive maps, live news updates
                        form validations, creating landing pages, etc.
