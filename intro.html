               <h1>About Me</h1>
               <p>My name is Lakshya kathayat .I am 22 year old . I have done my under graduation from Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology and Mangement college.
                I would introduce myself in seven words. Passionate coder, responsible person, best colleague ever. That pretty much sums it up, though at least the last one my former colleagues have to confirm. I try to do a good job in all roles I have in life, and I enjoy the process immensely.
                I value clarity, empathy, and integrity above all else. These ideals guide my approach to problem solving and life in general.
